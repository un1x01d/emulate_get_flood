# emulate_get_flood
This tool emulates a HTTP GET attack with random IPs in the header and random User-Agents

## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR ANY MALICIOUS ACTIVITY!!! - This method of "attack" is very poor and outdated, and is useful ONLY for testing.

## Usage
```
./emulate_get_flood.sh -x [threads] -t [timeout] -u [url]
```
